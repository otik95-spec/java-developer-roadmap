## üå± About This Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for **self-learners**, **students**, and **mentors** who want a clear, structured path to learning Java professionally.  
It includes **theory**, **practical exercises**, and **progress checklists** for each topic.

Each section can be completed step by step ‚Äî from basic syntax and object-oriented programming to advanced concepts like **asynchronous processing**, **Spring Boot**, and **cloud development**.

You can use this roadmap as:
- A **self-study guide** to build your own Java foundation
- A **mentorship plan** for guiding interns or junior developers
- A **reference** when preparing for technical interviews
