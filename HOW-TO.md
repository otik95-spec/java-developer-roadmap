# 📘 How to Work With This Roadmap

This **Java learning roadmap** designed for **self-learners**, **students**, and **mentorship programs**, allowing everyone to track progress, practice through tasks, and submit their solutions for review.

---

## 🚀 1. Fork the Repository

Start by creating your own copy of the roadmap so you can work on it freely and track your progress.

```bash
# On GitHub, click the "Fork" button (top-right)
```

This will create a personal copy of the roadmap in your GitHub account — for example:

```
https://github.com/your-username/java-developer-roadmap
```

You will complete tasks, notes, and solutions inside your fork.

---

## 🧭 2. Follow the Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is divided into **sections and subsections**, each in its own `.md` file for easier navigation and focus.

Example structure:

```
1. Java-Basics.md
2. OOP-in-Java.md
3. Language-Mechanisms.md
...
```

Each section includes:

* ✅ **Learning checklist** — follow and mark completed topics.
* 🧩 **Practice tasks** — solve exercises to apply what you learn.

You can copy the checklist into your notes or update it directly in your forked repo as you progress.

---

## 💻 3. Complete and Commit Tasks

Each topic contains one or more practical exercises.
For every task you complete, you can:

1. Create a new folder in your fork, e.g.:

   ```
   /tasks/src/t1basics
   ```
2. Add your solution files (`.java`, `.md`, or `.txt`).
3. Commit with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Completed variables task from Java Basics section"
   git push
   ```

This way, your progress is tracked and versioned — just like in a real development environment.

---

## 🤝 4. Work With a Mentor (Optional)

If you are working with a mentor:

1. Push your completed task to a separate branch in your fork.
2. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the main branch.
3. Add a short description of what you did and any questions you have.

Example PR title:

```
[Section 2] - OOP basics task completed
```

Mentors can review your code, leave inline comments, and suggest improvements directly in GitHub — just like in real-world projects.

---

## 🔄 5. Stay Updated With the Original Roadmap

To get new topics, updates, or fixes from the original roadmap:

1. Add the original roadmap as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/TechJamDevelopment/java-developer-roadmap.git
   ```
2. Fetch and merge changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
3. Resolve any merge conflicts if needed, then push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

This keeps your roadmap always up to date with the latest improvements.

---

## 🧠 6. Suggested Learning Workflow

Here’s how to make the most of this roadmap:

1. Read theory → mark as done ✅
2. Watch or read the linked resources
3. Solve tasks and commit your code
4. Get feedback (if working with mentor)
5. Reflect, refactor, and continue to the next section

Each section builds on the previous one, so take your time — the goal is understanding, not speed.

---

## 🏁 7. When You Finish

By the end, your forked repository will become your **personal Java learning portfolio** — showing:

* Your progress and understanding
* Completed tasks and solutions
* Code reviews and improvements from mentors

You can include this in your CV or share it as part of your developer portfolio.

---

### 💬 Contributing

If you find mistakes, have ideas for improvements, or want to add new sections:

* Open an issue or a pull request in the original repo.
* Describe your suggestion clearly and reference where it fits.

Together, we can make this roadmap better for everyone learning Java.
